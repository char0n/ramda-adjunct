/**
 * "lifts" a function to be the specified arity, so that it may "map over" objects that satisfy
 * the fantasy land Apply spec of algebraic structures.
 *
 * Lifting is specific for {@link https://github.com/scalaz/scalaz|scalaz} and {@link http://www.functionaljava.org/|functional java} implementations.
 * Old version of fantasy land spec were not compatible with this approach,
 * but as of fantasy land 1.0.0 Apply spec also adopted this approach.
 *
 * This function acts as interop for ramda <= 0.23.0 and {@link https://monet.github.io/monet.js/|monet.js}.
 *
 * More info {@link https://github.com/fantasyland/fantasy-land/issues/50|here}.

 * @memberOf RA

 * @category Function
 * @sig Apply a => Number -> (a... -> a) -> (a... -> a)
 * @param {Number} arity The arity of the lifter function
 * @param {Function} fn The function to lift into higher context
 * @return {Function} The lifted function
 * @see {@link http://ramdajs.com/docs/#lift|R.lift}, {@link http://ramdajs.com/docs/#ap|R.ap}

 *
 * const add3 = (a, b, c) => a + b + c;
 * const madd3 = RA.liftFN(3, add3);
 *
 * madd3(Maybe.Some(10), Maybe.Some(15), Maybe.Some(17)); //=> Maybe.Some(42)
 * madd3(Maybe.Some(10), Maybe.Nothing(), Maybe.Some(17)); //=> Maybe.Nothing()
